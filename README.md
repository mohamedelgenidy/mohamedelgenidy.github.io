## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built using foundational web technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of all sections.
* **CSS3:** For all custom styling, layout (Flexbox), and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactivity, DOM manipulation, and all dynamic features.

## ‚ú® Key Features

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) implements several key interactive features:

* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, using media queries.
* **Dynamic Typing Animation:** A "typing" effect on the homepage headline using the **Typed.js** library.
* **Active Link on Scroll:** The navigation bar automatically highlights the section the user is currently viewing.
* **Sticky Header:** The navigation bar locks to the top of the page when the user scrolls down.
* **Mobile-Friendly Menu:** A "hamburger" icon that toggles the navigation menu on small devices.
